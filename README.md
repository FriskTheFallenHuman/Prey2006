# ABOUT

_dhewm 3_ is a _Doom 3_ GPL source port, known to work on at least Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.

The goal of _dhewm 3_ is bring _DOOM 3_ with the help of SDL to all suitable
platforms.

Bugs present in the original _DOOM 3_ will be fixed (when identified) without
altering the original gameplay.

# CHANGES

Compared to the original _DOOM 3_, the changes of _dhewm 3_ worth mentioning are:

- 64-bit port
- SDL for low-level OS support, OpenGL and input handling
- OpenAL for audio output, all OS-specific audio backends are gone
- OpenAL EFX for EAX reverb effects (read: EAX-like sound effects on all platforms/hardware)
- Better support for widescreen (and arbitrary display resolutions)
- A portable build system based on CMake
- (Cross-)compilation with MinGW-w64

See [Changelog.md](./Changelog.md) for a more complete changelog.


# GENERAL NOTES

## Game data and patching

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

You must patch the game to the latest version (1.3.1). See the FAQ for details, including
how to get the game data from Steam on Linux or OSX.

Note that the original _Doom 3_ and _Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil_ (together with
_DOOM 3: BFG Edition_, which is *not* supported by dhewm3) are available from the Steam Store at

https://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/DOOM_3/

See https://dhewm3.org/#how-to-install for game data installation instructions.

## Compiling

The build system is based on CMake: http://cmake.org/

Required libraries are not part of the tree. These are:

- OpenAL (OpenAL Soft required, Creative's and Apple's versions are made of fail)
- SDL v1.2 or 2.0 (2.0 recommended)
- libcurl (optional, required for server downloads)
- Optionally, on non-Windows: libbacktrace (usually linked statically)
  - sometimes (e.g. on debian-based distros like Ubuntu) it's part of libgcc (=> always available),
    sometimes (e.g. Arch Linux, openSUSE) it's in a separate package
  - If this is available, dhewm3 prints more useful backtraces if it crashes

For **UNIX-like systems**, these libraries need to be installed (including the
developer files). It is recommended to use the software management tools of
your OS (apt, dnf, portage, BSD ports, [Homebrew for macOS](http://brew.sh), ...).

For **Windows**, there are three options:

- Use the provided binaries (recommended, see below)
- Compile these libraries yourself
- Use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) to install the dependencies
    - Remember to set `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` as described in their [Getting Started Guide](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html)

Create a distinct build folder outside of this source repository and issue
the cmake command there, pointing it at the neo/ folder from this repository:

`cmake /path/to/repository/neo`

**macOS** users need to point CMake at OpenAL Soft (better solutions welcome):

`cmake -DOPENAL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/openal-soft/lib/libopenal.dylib -DOPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openal-soft/include /path/to/repository/neo`

Newer versions of Homebrew install openal-soft to another directory, so use this instead:

`cmake -DOPENAL_LIBRARY="/opt/homebrew/opt/openal-soft/lib/libopenal.dylib" -DOPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR="/opt/homebrew/opt/openal-soft/include" /path/to/repo/neo`

### Compiling example using Ubuntu

Should be the same for Debian and other Debian-derivatives, but apart from the first step (installing
build dependecies) it should be the same on other Linux distros and even other UNIX-likes in general.

Open a terminal and follow these steps:

* Install build dependencies:  
  `sudo apt install git cmake build-essential libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev`  
    - The build-essential package on Debian/Ubuntu/... installs some basics for compiling code
      like GCC (incl. g++), GNU Make and the glibc development package
    - Instead of libcurl4-openssl-dev, other libcurl*-dev packages should also work - or none at all, curl is optional.
    - Not strictly necessary, but I recommend making libbacktrace available. On distributions not
      based on Debian, you may have to manually install some kind of libbacktrace development package.
* Use git to get the code from Github (alternatively you can also download the code as an archive and extract that):  
  `git clone https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3.git`
* Change into the dhewm3 directory, create a directory to build in and change into the build directory:  
  `cd dhewm3` then `mkdir build` then `cd build`
* Create a Makefile with CMake: `cmake ../neo/`
    - You can set different options for CMake with arguments like `-DDEDICATED=ON` (to enable the dedicated server).
      You can show a list of supported options by running `cmake -LH ../neo/`. You can run CMake again
      with another `-DFOO=BAR` option to change that option (previously set options are remembered,
      unless you remove all contents of the build/ dir).
    - You could also install the **cmake-qt-gui** package and run `cmake-gui ../neo/`, which will let
      you configure the build in a GUI instead of using `-D` commandline-arguments.
* Compile dhewm3: `make -j8`
    - `-j8` specifies the number of compiler processes to run in parallel (8 in this example),
      it makes sense to use the number of CPU threads (or cores) in your system.

When all steps are done and no errors occurred, you should be able to run dhewm3 right there, like:  
`./dhewm3 +set fs_basepath /path/to/your/doom3/`  
*Replace `/path/to/your/doom3/` with the path to your Doom3 installation (that contains `base/` with
`pak000.pk4` to `pak008.pk4`)*

### Using the provided Windows binaries

Get a clone of the latest binaries here: https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3-libs

There are two subfolders:

- 32-bit binaries are located in `i686-w64-mingw32`
- 64-bit binaries are located in `x86_64-w64-mingw32`

Issue the appropriate command from the build folder, for example (for VS2019 and 32bit):

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`

For 64bit dhewm3 binaries, use `-A x64` and `/path/to/dhewm3-libs/x86_64-w64-mingw32` instead (note that the official dhewm3 binaries for Windows are 32bit).  
For Visual Studio 2022 it's `"Visual Studio 17 2022"`.

For 32bit MinGW use:
`cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`

The binaries are compatible with MinGW-w64 and all MSVC versions.

### Cross-compiling

For cross-compiling, a CMake Toolchain file is required.

For the MinGW-w64 toolchain `i686-w64-mingw32` on Ubuntu 12.04, it looks like:

```
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR i686)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)
set(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-windres)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /usr/i686-w64-mingw32)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

Then point CMake at your toolchain file:
`cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/Toolchain.cmake -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`

If you want to build for x86_64 aka AMD64 aka x64, replace all instances of `i686`
in the toolchain file with `x86_64`.

## Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows

The Doom 3 GPL source code release **did** not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as
"Carmack's Reverse".  
It has been restored in dhewm3 1.5.1 after Creative Labs' [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6384822B1/en)
finally expired.

Note that this did not change the visual appearance of the game, and didn't seem to
make a noticeable performance difference (on halfway-recent hardware) either.

you can obtain the SDK from Autodesk.
