# other systems either, for example on Linux with 32bit userland but 64bit kernel it returned the kernel CPU type
# (e.g. x86_64 instead of i686). Instead of fixing this, CMake eventually updated their documentation in 3.20,
# now it's officially the same as CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR except when cross-compiling (where it's explicitly set)
